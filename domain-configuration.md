### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The ALB DNS name is not an IP address, so **it cannot be used in an A record** ‚Äî it must be used with a **CNAME**.
- The **A record for `www` pointing to the IP should be removed**, or it may conflict with the CNAME.
- Only `www.bluebex.xyz` is currently using **HTTPS via ALB**. The root domain (`bluebex.xyz`) still routes directly to the EC2 instance.
