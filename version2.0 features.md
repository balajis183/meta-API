### 📦 Summary of Backend Work — Meta Application Version 2.0 (Features + Enhancements)

---

#### 1️⃣ Sort Messages by Recent (Latest on Top)

**✅ Implemented:**

* A dedicated `lastMessage` object is stored in Firebase under each user's chat node.
* This object includes: `content`, `timestamp`, `date`, `time`, and `unixTimestamp`.
* The app team uses `unixTimestamp` to sort chats in descending order (recent chats on top).

**📁 Firebase Structure:**

```json
chats/{phoneNumber}/lastMessage: {
  content: "Hey there!",
  timestamp: "2025-05-13T10:15:00Z",
  date: "2025-05-13",
  time: "03:45 PM",
  unixTimestamp: 1747133000
}
```

---

#### 2️⃣ Date Format for Messages (Today, Yesterday, Month Day)

**✅ Implemented:**

* The backend stores messages with multiple time formats:

  * ISO timestamp
  * Readable date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
  * Formatted time (e.g., `03:45 PM`)
  * Unix timestamp (for comparisons)
* The frontend uses this data to display friendly formats like:

  * `Today`
  * `Yesterday`
  * `May 13`

**📁 Stored in Firebase for every message:**

```json
{
  content: "Hello",
  timestamp: "2025-05-13T10:15:00Z",
  date: "2025-05-13",
  time: "03:45 PM",
  unixTimestamp: 1747133000
}
```

#### 3️⃣ ➕ Add Button to Start New Chat

**✅ Implemented with Meta Template API:**

* Because WhatsApp doesn’t allow sending messages to new users without consent, we use a pre-approved template.
* This template politely asks users to start the chat by sending “Hi.”

**🛠 Backend Support:**

* An API was created to trigger the template by passing the phone number.
* Shared with the app team.

**🔗 Used API:** `/send-template?phone=+919123456789`

---

#### 4️⃣ 🔍 Search in Chat List

**✅ Fully Handled by App Team (No Backend Work Needed)**

* The app team implemented a search to filter messages by name, number, or text.
* No backend support was required as all data is locally cached by the app.

---

#### 5️⃣ Message Notifications and Unread Indicators

**🧩 5a. Unread Message Count (per chat):**

* Each incoming message increments the `unreadCount` under that phone number in Firebase.
* Once the message is read, this count resets.

**🧩 5b. Unread Conversations (Total Count):**

* A centralized field `chats/unreadConversations` is incremented only **if unreadCount becomes 1**.
* This prevents double-counting the same chat multiple times.

**📁 Sample Firebase Data:**

```json
chats/{phoneNumber}/unreadCount: "3"
chats/unreadConversations: 5
```

**✅ Status Webhook:**

* WhatsApp webhook listens for `status: read`
* When status is `read`, `unreadCount` resets to `0`

**🧠 Intelligent Logic:**

* `.transaction()` is used to safely increment both counts in concurrent environments.

---

### ✅ Testing Status

* All 5 features have been fully tested on both frontend and backend.
* End-to-end test coverage includes new message delivery, read statuses, sort orders, and search experience.

---

### 🚀 LIVE Implementation Highlights

* Robust Firebase schema
* Real-time message sorting
* Role-safe WhatsApp message triggers
* Clear separation of logic for counting unread vs. conversations
* Seamless UX on mobile with backend-driven enhancements

---

### 🔚 Final Note

The backend is optimized and scalable for future features like archiving chats, multi-admin reads, and push alerts per message type. Ready for deployment and production usage.
