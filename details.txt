From the past 3 working days i.e. from 22-03-2025 this is progress... for setting up WhatsApp API cloud we need to have 4 fields, we need to create Meta developer account . After creating we  require 4 fields  Phone number Id,  Access token for Authentication , from and to number .    


While coming to Authentication , part we have created a  permanent access token so it resolves the security concern !

As per the meta policy we can't send a promotional message without the user consent or without the user initiates the chat... so we have created many API URLs with the user consent like text-message, pdf-file, image with caption, address, audio, text-message with url, location, video, contact etc. it's through without use the template..

The only solution for sending the message without the user consent we need to use approved  WhatsApp templates provided by Meta.  


Although we are able to send the template using the test number provided by meta .. it also requires the user consent like requiring OTP...

for time being we have using the test number for sending the templates..

We have also created some templates for test message,  purchase_1 ( from pdf ) , pdf format  and greetings template ( visit the website /call phone no)

The challenges  is that we were unable send through a template with the official business account is it requires business info in order to send message without the consent of user .

Once we update the business info we will able to send templates from the official business WhatsApp Account.

Also we can add terms of service too then it would be perfect to send optimize messages for customers.
