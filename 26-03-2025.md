# WhatsApp API Cloud Integration

## Overview
This project focuses on integrating the WhatsApp API Cloud to enable businesses to send messages to customers using pre-approved WhatsApp templates. The implementation ensures seamless business-initiated messaging without requiring customer interaction beforehand.

## Implementation Progress

### Business-Initiated Messaging
- Successfully implemented the ability to send messages using WhatsApp templates.
- WhatsApp templates allow businesses to send messages without requiring user interaction, as they are pre-approved.
- Business information has been updated successfully, fulfilling all necessary requirements to send messages.

### Sending Documents and Media
- Instead of hosting documents or images on a public URL, we identified an optimized method:
  - Upload files directly to Metaâ€™s servers.
  - Retrieve a `MEDIA_ID` from Metaâ€™s server.
  - Use the `MEDIA_ID` to send the media files as a part of the WhatsApp message.

### Webhooks for Message Responses
- Currently working on setting up webhooks to capture user responses to business-initiated messages.
- This will help in tracking engagement and improving customer interactions.

### Pricing Exploration
- Investigating WhatsApp Business pricing based on message categories.
- Pricing details have been documented in our GitHub repository.

- Enhance automation and tracking of message interactions.
- Optimize message categories to reduce costs while maximizing efficiency.

This integration ensures a scalable and compliant way to engage customers effectively using WhatsApp Business API Cloud. ðŸš€
